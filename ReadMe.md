# HCC Data Exploration and Modeling

The prject consits on the exploration of the Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC) dataset and involves building a comprehensive data science workflow, starting from exploring and analyzing the data to preparing it for analysis, then applying various supervised learning methods for classification, and finally assessing their performance
